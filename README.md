# LyaHCDs
*Annotated Jupyter notebooks and notes about the influence of HCDs on Lyman-alpha forest correlation from research conducted during OSU SURP 2022 and the 2022-23 academic year*

- AU22 DESI Research: written record from autumn 2022 of important notebooks from the summer and what they do, which models/mocks are being evaluated, plots created, and problems encountered
- DESI Comprehensive Notes: written record from summer 2022 of all weekly notes
- SP23 DESI Research: written record from spring 2023 of past/current steps, plots created, future goals, and problems encountered
- Vega Fits: excel file of all recorded fits from cases run in the terminal (AP, BAO, chi-squared)
- fitter_plots_autocross: Jupyter notebook of plots measuring the efficiency of different models to determine the Alcock-Paczynski parameter, $\phi_{s}$, for the autocross correlation under different mock conditions
- fitter_plots_outputs: Jupyter notebook of plots measuring the efficiency of different models to determine the Alcock-Paczynski parameter, $\phi_{s}$, for the auto correlation under different mock conditions, a 2-D plot of BAO parameters, and a triangle plot of 5 parameters
- mock_model_plots: Jupyter notebook of plots measuring the efficiency of different models to determine the Alcock-Paczynski parameters, $\phi_{s}$ and $\alpha_{s}$, for the auto correlation under different mock conditions
- picca: Jupyter notebook that computes the correlation function in Fourier space for different mock conditions and compares them to two exponential models
- piccaoutputs: Jupyter notebook that computes correlation functions for realistic, HCD -> 20, and HCD -> 17 mocks and produces output txt files for each that are used to create the Fvoigt model
